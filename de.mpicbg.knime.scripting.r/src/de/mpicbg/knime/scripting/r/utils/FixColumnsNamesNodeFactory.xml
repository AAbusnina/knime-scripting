    <shortDescription>

        <intro>
            <p>
                Renames automatically column headers to obtain valid column names for an R data-frame. By default this
                is done by replacing certain operator symbols
                if they are the first character in the column name.
            </p>
            <p>
                Operator symbols that are replaced (using KNIME):
                "+" is replace by "Plus",
                <br/>
                "-" is replace by "Minus",
                <br/>
                "*" is replace by "Times",
                <br/>
                "%" is replace by "Percent",
                <br/>
                ":" is replace by "DivBy",
                <br/>
                "/" is replace by "DivBy".
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively the R can be used to generate R-compatible column names. Then the Rserve needs to be
                running and R uses the funtion "make.names".

                IMPORTANT :
                <br/>
                If this option is checked then this node is using R as backend, make sure that Rserve is running
                somewhere, and Knime is accordingly
                configured (Knime->Preferences).

        <option name="Use strict name matching">If enabled the node will use the method make.names of R to make
            R-compatible column names.
